# Framework with Trento initial conditions

the `init.h5` hdf5 file contains initial energy density conditions generated by `trento Pb Pb 10 -o init.h5`.
to run a simulation do `./new <er> <cells> <len> <event id>` where:
<er>: value of the maximum implicit error
<cells>: number of cells in one direction (for the default trento that generates grid 100x100 then the value must be 100)
<len>: physical lenght in fm (for default trenta that generates grids of 20x20 fm^2 (from -10fm to 10fm) then the value must be 20)
<event id>: the id of the initial condition to use (by default trento fills the `event/` with data file that have a number for name and ends with `.dat` extension)

Then the result folder is created. It contains:
- the parameter file ending by `.ron` that correspond to the values chosed above,
- the raw data
- the end energy density as a matrix in the file starting by `mat_`
- the anisotropy evolution as function of time in the file starting by `anisotropy_` (first colomn is time, the second is anisotropy so <T11-T22>/<T11+T22> where <...> is the mean over space)

example:
`./new 0.001 100 20 0`

You can a default new generated initial condition with `./auto`
